        For easy-schema-examples we don't want the name of the base directory to include
        the version number (e.g., "easy-schema-examples-1.x-SNAPSHOT"). It should be just "easy-schema-example" to facilitate the
        usage of this package as a maven resource dependency. (See the easy-app/lib/dmm project for example.)
